# CatBot-Backend

This is the source code for the back-end of the CatBot, a german travel-chatbot with a frame-based Dialogue-System. You can find the source code of the front-end right [here](). 

The whole system is currently hosted [here](https://travel-catbot.de).





## How-To install and use the system:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [spacy](https://spacy.io/) for german (versions sm and md)
3. If you want to test and debug the whole website, clone and start the front-end as well, otherwise skip to 6
4. Start the main.py (make sure to be in the same folder to avoid import errors)
5. Now you can chat with the bot on the local website.
6. If you just want to test and debug the NLP-Engine, you can work with the integrationtests: Start integrationtests.py
7. Now you can debug the tests in tests/testNLPAnalyzer and tests/testNLPAnswerer
8. The tests are incomplete, if you want to, you can experiment with more inputs and states
